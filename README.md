# kenshi-mod-tools
Two small but useful tools for maintaining the kenshi mod directory.

USAGE: 
run "link-workshop-files.bat" from within your "../steam/steamapps/common/kenshi/mods" folder.  This will create softlinks in the form of ntfs junctures to the target directories and rename them as suitable.  This makes your downloaded steam files remain current to the workshop content you are basing them on when including and modifying workshop items.

run "link-personal-files.bat" from within your mods folder as well if like me you want to keep your own personal work in another location and use your steam mods folder as a publish target.  I do this just for housekeeping but it's not necessary.  Just please remember to store your mods on github.  Learn from our mistakes, please.

I hope this helps someone.
